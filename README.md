# Election-Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
This project involved helping a Colorado Board of Elections employee, "Tom" perform an election audit. This was to cover total number of votes cast, total votes for each candidate, percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner based on the popular vote for a United States congressional precinct in Colorado. The manager at the Colorado Board of Elections office wanted to know if the process could be automated using Python.

The election commission requested that the votes cast in each county, county percentage of the total number of votes and the county with the highest number of votes cast be provided.

## Election-Audit Summary
With some modifications, this program can be used for any election. One example of modification that would be needed would be replacement of counties and candidates from this election with those to be audited in other elections. Another would be assignment of different paths to the file_to_load variable with election data from other elections.
